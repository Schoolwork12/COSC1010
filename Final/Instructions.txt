This is a blackjack program with a set amount of money you can input that you can gamble with
this file will serve as a pseudo code and explinations for why I put something in place or not

1. first I will need a cool little ascii art for the main page of the program --done

2. then I will need input for the amount of money they want to gamble with, maybe add a little easter egg
    for when they enter a high or low amount (such as text saying that theyre poor or if they input high
        I might say theyre feeling cocky today or that theyre a highroller) --done

3. then I'm thinking I will need to of course import the random lib for the "drawing" --done

4. I'm thinking I will have to add a dictionary for what the numbers relate to such as 10: (queen ascii art etc) the thing I might have to do since
    I dont think I can fit the actual art with that code instead perhaps have it relate to a variable that has the ascii art in it, like "queen" --> (ascii)
    but that is something I will have to look-up --done but also didn't have to do it how I thought, I just imported the function that relates to it and 
        used that

5. then use the random function to draw max two random cards at the start and add an option to "hit me" aka draw another card and if the value exceeds 21 you lose
    if not they can continue, I will also have to add the double down to double the bet theyre placing and draw another card
    then there is the stand, where they dont draw and its the "dealers" turn --done

6. I will have to figure out how to hide the second card maybe I could instead have them draw one card face up, and instead of the second it auto does the card back ascii
    art, then when its their turn to draw it auto does a .random draw of a card + till they get to a certain number --done the back card is backwards(it should be
    on the right) but oh well

7. I will have to put a limit on what they draw such as if its a 16 or greater then they dont draw, then of course if they get over 21 they bust and you win 2x --done

8. additionally adding a natural bonus would be a plus say 2.5x or something if you draw a natural 21 --didnt add since I dont want to give the player more money hehe

9. ace's might be a bit to figure out due to it being either a 1 or 11 but I could put something that if player has an ace then if they go over 21 once then it does a 
    minus 10 to the amount you have --done they were easier than I thought to add

10. added a section that if you lose all your money the dealer berates you (as usual) and the game closes otherwise you can play another game

11. Might add a imported function that picks a random dealer line in some sections just to spice things up, might have to add another file
    just so things dont get messy in the main program file, shouldnt be hard to implement, just an import function and run that though a .random and it should do 

    ^^^ this is done and implemented

KNOWN BUGS TO POSSIBLY FIX |
___________________________|

Bug 1.
if you mess up the input in the hit/stand/ or double down section it will correctly berate the player, but then the dealers hand is cleared so you cant see 
his hand anymore but only yours, otherwise it works fine and will continue to play correctly. This might take some time to fix since the dealers hand is
in another function, I could get rid of the clear_sc() function but I have a feeling this would mess up the program more, such as getting a duplicate on the screen
and make it look ugly

Bug 2. --- fixed
if you input a random word or letter/number in the would you like to play again section (intakes only y or n) it will default to you leaving, I might add a section
that makes the dealer berate you again and then asks the y or n question again
